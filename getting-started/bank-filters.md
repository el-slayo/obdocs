# Bank Filters

There are a multitude of bank filters you can use to easily identify or search items in your bank. You can start by typing the `+b` command to display your bank. It is also possible to view the different pages of your bank with `+b X` (X being any page number).

### Searching Your Bank

There are 2 ways to search your bank for items.

* `/bank item:[Full Item Name]`
  * This command only returns results when the full item name is entered.
* `/bank search:[partial/full item name]`
  * This command will return anything that contains the term searched.

### Universal Filters

The following bank filters can be used with either of the bank search commands to display further information about each item or display the search results in a different format.

**Note:** You can combine many of these universal filters in your bank search (in any order).

* `--names` - displays the name of each item
* `--text` - displays the names of items in plain text format
* `--sv` - displays the sell value of items
* `--av` - displays the alch value of items
* `--id` - displays the ID of items
* `--ph` - includes currently equipped items (and their value) in your search results
* `--full` - displays the entire bank search in one image (or full bank if no other filters used)
* `--wide` - displays a wider bank image (MUST be used with --full)
* `--sort=name/value/alch` - sorts your results by name, value, or alch price
* `--text --full` - allows you to export your bank items in plain text format

The following command is an example of a bank search for the term "rune" with many filters.&#x20;

* E.g. `+bs rune --full --wide --sort=name --names`
